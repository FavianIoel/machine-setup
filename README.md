Machine Web Dev Setup 
=====================
⛔️ DEPRECATED - you can still use it as a startpoint but shure to check the repos.

I made this script after I noticed I spent a lot of time installing tools
after a new Ubuntu installation , Xenial 16 has some new stuff so the old 
ways to configure mysql and PHP are not quite valid this time .

With this script I have a machine ready to work within about 30 minutes 
(with the installation of OS included)

I shared this script with a lot of friends that upgraded their OS and wanted
 the new PHP7 :)

It comes with some additional stuff so if you want, you can edit the script 
and remove some of its features , or add extra features .

Thanks for the attention and be productive.
